# Text AutoComplete Engine
Grade: 90%

## What?
This is my implementation of an autocomplete engine you might see on your phone using DLB Tries.

## Files
  ### App.java
  Main file for the AutoComplete Engine.
  
  ### AutoComplete_Inter.java
  Interface for the AutoComplete.java file. Contains the main functions and the high level descriptions of those functions.

  Heart of the program. This file uses both DLB.java and UserHistory.java to create the auto-completion engine.

  Half of the brains of the project. This file is responsible for the storage of the dictionary.
  
  ### DLBNode.java
  DLB Node class for the DLB.java file.

  Modified DLBNode.java file made for the UserHistory.java file.
  
  ### Dict.java
  Interface file for both DLB and UserHistory
  
  ### UserHistory.java
  Other half of the brains of the project. This file is responsible for the storage of the User History.
