# HeftyInteger (Big Integer Implementation)

## What?
 This is my simplified implementation of Java's BigInteger

### How?
This project was done mainly using bit manipulation, mainly focusing on basic arithmetic and GCD functions. Each HeftyInteger is treated as an array of bytes.

## Main Functions
  ### Add
    Sums the two HeftyInteger's together.
    
  ### Subtract
    Subtracts one HeftyInteger by another.

  ### Multiply 
    Multiplies one HeftyInteger by another using GradeSchool.
    
  ### Divide 
    Divides one HeftyInteger by another using Long Division with bits.
    
  ### XGCD
    Extended Euclidians algorithm for calculating GCD.
